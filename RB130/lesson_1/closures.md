## Closures

### What are closures?

Closures are a programming concept that allow you to save a 'chunk of code' to use and execute at a later time. 

It is called an closure at it 'encloses' surrounding artifacts and binds them together. This allows the closure to be used at a later date. 

You can think of it as a method that can be passed around the program and used but is not defined using method definition syntax of `def` and `end` or given an explicit name. 

There are three main ways to create a closure: 

* Instantiating an object from a `Proc` class.
* Using `lambdas`
* Using `blocks`
